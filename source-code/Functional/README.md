# Functional
Examples of functional programming style in C++.

## What is it?
1. [aggregate.cpp](aggregate.cpp): implements a vector reduction with a reductor function
    as an argument, and lambda functions are provided as arguments. (Note
    that C++ STL has this algorithm implmented in a more general way.
1. [StreamingData](StreamingData): comparison between functional and object-oriented approach
   to computing streaming statistics.
