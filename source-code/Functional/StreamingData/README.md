# StteamingData

Comparison between a functional and OO approach to computing running statistics.

## What is it?

1. [stats_functional.h](stats_functional.h): functional implemenation using higher order functions
   and shared pointers.
1. [main_functional.cpp](main_functional.cpp): main function that reads from standard input and
   uses functional approach.
1. [stats_oo.h](stats_oo.h): object-oriented implemenation using parenthesis overloading.
1. [main_oo.cpp](main_oo.cpp): main function that reads from standard input and
   uses object-oriented approach.
1. [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt): CMake file to build the applications.
1. [generate_data.py](generate_data.py) Python script to generate large data files.
1. [data.txt](data.txt): small data file to experiment with.


## Contributors

Thanks to Jakob Randa for suggesting a solution with unique rather than shared
pointers.
