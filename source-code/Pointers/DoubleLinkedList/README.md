# DoubleLinkedList

Implementation of a double linked list that takes only 2*N* space.   This illustrates
that raw pointers are sometimes required when designing container. It also
illustrates the implementation of an iterator so that the container can
be used in a range-for loop.

## What is it?

1. [src](src): source directory
   1. [double_linked_list.h](src/double_linked_list.h): definition and implementation of the container.
   1. [main.cpp](src/main.cpp): application to illustrate the use of the container.
   1. [CMakeLists.txt](src/CMakeLists.txt): CMake file to build the application.
1. [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt): CMake file to build the application.
