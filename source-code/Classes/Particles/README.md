# Particles
Simple example of inheritance in C++.
# What is it?
1. [static_particle.h](static_particle.h): declaration of particle base class.
1. [static_particle.cpp](static_particle.cpp): particle base class implementation.
1. [particle.h](particle.h): declaration of derived class for particles with velocity.
1. [particle.cpp](particle.cpp): implementation of derived class.
1. [main.cpp](main.cpp): main program to illustrate the use of dervied class.
1. [Makefile](Makefile): make file to build the applications.
