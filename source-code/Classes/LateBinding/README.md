# LateBinding

Example of a base class and a derived class where late binding is required.

## What is it?

1. [stats.h](stats.h): defintion of a class to compute trivial statistics on a data
   stream.
1. [stats.cpp](stats.cpp) definition of member functions of the `Stats` class.
1. [median_stats.h](median_stats.h): defintion of a class derived from `Stats` that adds the
   ability to compute the median.
1. [median_stats.cpp](median_stats.cpp) defintion of member functions of the `MedianStats` class.
1. [stats_main.cpp](stats_main.cpp): application that computes statistics on data read from
   standard input.  If the `-m` option is specified on the command line, it
   will also compute the median in addition to the trivial statistics.
1. [Makefile](Makefile): make file to build the application.
1. [data.txt](data.txt): small data file to test the application.
