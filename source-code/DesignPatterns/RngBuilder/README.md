1. [rng.cpp](rng.cpp): class implementation of a pseudo-random number generator.
1. [rng_builder.h](rng_builder.h): class definition of a builder for `Rng` objects,
    using method chaining.
1. [rng_builder.cpp](rng_builder.cpp): class implementation of a builder for `Rng` objects.
1. [rng_runner.cpp](rng_runner.cpp): main function to demo the builder.
1. [Makefile](Makefile): make file to build the application.
