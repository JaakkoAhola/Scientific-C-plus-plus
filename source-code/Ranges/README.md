# Ranges
Ranges help to deal more conveniently with STL containers, and the
composition of algorithms.  Part of this functionality will most likely
rolled into the C++20 standard.

## What is it?
1. [transform_accumulate.cpp](transform_accumulate.cpp): simple example of chaining a
    transformation and an accumulator on a vector.
1. [Makefile](Makefile): make file to build the applications.
