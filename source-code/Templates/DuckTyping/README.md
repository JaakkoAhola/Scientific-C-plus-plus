# DuckTyping
Example of using a template for duck typing.

## What is it?
1. [simpson_quad.h](simpson_quad.h): class that implements Simpson quadrature.
1. [simpson_quad.cpp](simpson_quad.cpp): implementation of `SimpsonQuad` methods.
1. [gaussian_quad.h](gaussian_quad.h): class that implementation Gaussian quadrature.
1. [gaussian_quad.cpp](gaussian_quad.cpp): implementation of `GaussianQuad` methods.
1. [main_quad.cpp](main_quad.cpp): main function that drives the quadrature using an
    algorithm determined at runtime, either based on `SimpsonQuad`, or
    `GaussianQuad`.
1. [Makefile](Makefile): make file to build the application.
