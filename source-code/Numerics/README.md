# Numerics
Code illustrations for chapter 9, Numerics in Stroustrup's
"A tour of C++".

# What is it?
1. [complex.cpp](complex.cpp): illustration using complex numbers and `valarray`.
1. [julia.cpp](julia.cpp): more interesting example of complex number arithmetic.
1. [plot_julia.plt](plot_julia.plt): gnuplot script to plot the Julia set.
1. [limits.cpp](limits.cpp): illustrates limits for integer and floating point types,
    as well as test for infinity and NaN.
1. [random.cpp](random.cpp): example of generating a seed using a random device, to
    create an engine for the distribution of interest.
1. [multiple_distr.cpp](multiple_distr.cpp): shows how to bind an engine to multiple
    distributions using a reference wrapper.
1. [Makefile](Makefile): make file to build the code.
